How to install and build the system for this project:

1. Begin by updating OPAM if you have not already by running the following in 
your terminal:
$ opam update
$ opam upgrade

2. Now in order to get an understanding of hhow the game is played, run the
following commands in your terminal: 
$ dune build
$ dune exec bin/main.exe -- -h

3. In order to run the game, run the following in your terminal to open up
the git log that logs how long it takes two players to complete one game of 
Caravan of Camels:
$ dune exec bin/main.exe log [ip_address] [port]

4. Now in order for two players to actually play the game, in a different 
terminal run this command in your terminal:
$ dune exec bin/main.exe users [ip_address] [port] [player1_name] [player2_name]

3. After running the commands above you should see the game boards as well as a
message reading "Welcome to Caravan of Camels!". 
This indicates the game has begun and you can proceed to enter your inputs 
based on the messages. First player1 takes their turn then player2 takes their
turn and it continues to alternate (this is also explained in the help 
command as listed above in step 2)
