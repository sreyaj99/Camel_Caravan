  Our project is a twist on the traditional game of Battleship. However, instead
  of battleships, the game is played with camels. The game consists of a grid 
  and is a two player game. On the grid, there is one camel placed randomly and
  a caravan of two camels placed randomly. The players have to take turns
  guessing where the camels are placed on the grid by inputting the 
  grid coordinates. Whatever player guesses where all the camels are placed
  first, wins the game! The two players play the same game on the same 
  terminal in which they alternate turns. There is also a game log that the 
  users can connect to; this game log stores the user's names, 
  when they connect to the game log, when they disconnect to the game log, and 
  the combined time it takes for the two users to complete the one game of 
  Caravan of Camels. Additionaly, two player pairing can join along with other
  two player pairing also! The interface is completely programmable as new 
  functions can be added and grid dimensions can be easily changed or modified. 
  The board is designed using arrays. 

  Standard visual I/O is supported. The board is outputted and the user can
  input the coordinates they would like to get through the terminal.
